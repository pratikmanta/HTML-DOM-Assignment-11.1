                programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page so that
                programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents
                the document as nodes and objects.<br>That way, programming languages can connect to
                the page.”</p>
        <p id = "para2">A Web page is a document. This document
                can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. But it is the same
                document in both cases. The Document Object Model (DOM) represents that same
                document so it can be manipulated.<br> The DOM is an object-oriented representation of
                the web page, which can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.</p>
